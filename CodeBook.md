#Getting the Raw data

Raw data is obtained from UCI Machine learning repository. The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 


#Cleaning the data

Following steps are performed using run_analysis R script for data cleaning:

a) Set the working directory
b) Download the dataset into the working directory
c) Reads all text files : X_test.txt, X_train.txt, test_subject_id, train_subject_id, test_activity_id, train_activity_id, activity_labels.txt, features.txt into different data frames
d) Labels the columns in all data frames
e) Merges the test data sets  and training data set into one data frame
f) In the merged data set, keep only columns referring to mean and std deviation.
g) Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
h) The end result is shown in the file Tidy_data.txt.


#Tidy_data.txt Details

##Below are details of identifiers in file Tidy_data.txt:

a) "activity_id : ID of activity performed
b) "activity_name" : Name of activity performed
c) "subject_id" : ID of subject

##Activity Labels: Below are the activity labels: 

a) WALKING
b) WALKING_UPSTAIRS
c) WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
d) SITTING
e) STANDING
